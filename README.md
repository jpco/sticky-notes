STICKYNOTES

I hated the default Windows StickyNotes program, so I decided to make one myself. It's designed to work with Dropbox, so all files can be synced between computers. It's meant to be SIMPLE--no bells or whistles, small window decorations, lightweight (as lightweight as Java gets, I mean.)

To-do!
 - Tiling WM support: though the StickyNotes themselves are fine (using custom window decorations and all,) the dialogs and open/close/etc windows don't work with a tiling WM which doesn't add borders.
 - Settings: 
 	- change default StickyNote size (or, possibly, make the size changeable at all!)
	- change file-folder. This isn't useful for myself, so who knows when I'll care about it.
 - Better file services: delete/rename files, more attractive browser, etc. (folders, even?)
 - Don't save unchanged notes (so new/blank notes don't clutter things up)
 - make universally ``attractive'' so it works with a tiling WM/openJDK/Debian (ha, as if. Tiling WM, *attractive*?)
